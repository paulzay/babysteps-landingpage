      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This project was birthed from an idea I had when I looked at my own life and thought what could I build right now that
      I can use in my own life. I have a daughter and I have been using a baby book to track her milestones and growth.
       I thought to myself, what if I could build a digital version of this book that could be used by parents 
       all over the world. That's how Babysteps was born. It started as a portfolio project for <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/">ALX</a>
      and I aim to build it into a fully mature app with all the features that parents need to track their child's growth and development
